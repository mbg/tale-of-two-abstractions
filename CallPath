Base class

This case is simple. If the object is in the `Data' configuration, then it is an
"honest" object, so we should just run the implementation. If it is in the `Start'
configuration, then it is really an object constructed using some sub-class that we
don't know anything about, so we should forward the call to that class's instance.

        | Primary | Primary (Identity) | Parental | Parental (Identity)
Data    | run     | <-                 | N/A      | N/A
Start   | forward | <-                 | N/A      | N/A
Middle  | N/A     | N/A                | N/A      | N/A
End     | N/A     | N/A                | N/A      | N/A

Sub-class

This case is complicated. 

        | Primary | Primary (Identity) | Parental | Parental (Identity)
Data    | run     | invoke             | run/lift | invoke/forward
Start   | forward | Impossible.        | forward  | Impossible.
Middle  | forward | invoke             | forward  | invoke/forward
End     | run     | invoke             | run/lift | invoke/forward
